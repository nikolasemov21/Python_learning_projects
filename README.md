# Python_learning_projects
This repository is for uploading my python learning projects trough the course of learning python programing.

# oop_coffee_machine
I made this simple project as task for understanding and training classes, attributes and methods in python. 
The program is simple, when the user runs it he/she has choice of what type of coffee he/she want's (latte/espresso/cappuccino), after this the program checks if there is enough resources(milk, coffee, water) and asks the user to enter money into the machine. If the resources and the money are enough, the machine serves the drink and gives the user change. The machine keeps track of how much resources are used. The user can turn the machine off by typing "off" and get report about the resources available by typing "report".

# Turtle Drawing
This simple project is made using the turtle module (for more information on the module check here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html).
The program contains couple of functions in the functions.py file that are made to draw different shapes. To select what you want to draw you have to go in the main.py file and uncomment the line with the correct function that you want to use. The idea of the project is to train working with modules and some OOP traning.

# Turtle key drawing
App that uses the turtle module. User can use a keyboard keys to draw. 
Keybinds:
w - moves the turtle forwards with pendown </br>
s - moves the turtle backwards with pendown
a - turns the turtle left
d - turns the turtle right
Up arrow - moves the turtle forwards with penup
Down arrow - moves the turtle backwards with penup
c -clears the screen and return the turtle in starting position

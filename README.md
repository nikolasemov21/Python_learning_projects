# Coffe_machine_oop
I made this simple project as task for understanding and training classes, attributes and methods in python. 
The program is simple, when the user runs it he/she has choice of what type of coffee he/she want's (latte/espresso/cappuccino), after this the program checks if there is enough resources(milk, coffee, water) and asks the user to enter money into the machine. If the resources and the money are enough, the machine serves the drink and gives the user change. The machine keeps track of how much resources are used. The user can turn the machine off by typing "off" and get report about the resources available by typing "report".
